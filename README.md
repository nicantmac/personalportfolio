# Personal Portfolio - 👉 [Visit Me](https://nickcodes.netlify.app)

My developer portfolio built with React and Vite. It's the starter-pack to display simple web dev skills in my journey as an aspiring full-stack developer. Going for a clean design, I enhanced UI with implemeting a11y and internationalization.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- React + Vite
- GSAP for animations
- a11y (for web accessibility)
- i18next (for internationalization)
